# Fancy XO

Implementations of the popular X & O game

## Features

- Implement AI: You can add an AI player to the game, which will make it more challenging for the human player and also provide an opportunity to explore TypeScript's object-oriented programming features.
- Multiplayer support: You can add support for multiplayer, allowing players to play against each other over the internet. This will require additional functionality such as a server-client architecture and networking code.
- Different game modes: You can add different game modes such as a 3x3 board or different winning conditions such as diagonal wins.
- Game statistics: You can add functionality to track statistics such as the number of wins, losses, and ties for each player.
- User interface improvements: You can improve the user interface by adding animations, sound effects, and other visual enhancements.
- Game history: You can add a feature that allows players to review their past games, which will require you to store the game state information.

  These are just a few suggestions, and there are many other ways to make the game more complex. The key is to think about what features would be interesting to implement and what will give you the opportunity to explore different aspects of TypeScript.
